The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:  .container { display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; } .item { width: 50%; height: 100px; background-color: blue; }  The issue is that the blue div(.item) does not take the full 50% width of the container.  The problem lies in the fact that the `width: 50%;` is calculated relative to the parent's *content* area, not its full width. If the container has any padding or border, those will take up space, leaving less space for the item's 50%.
